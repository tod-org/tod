When performing a code review, suggest improvements that make the Rust code more idiomatic and readable. Suggest refactoring opportunities for deeply nested code and make sure that function and variable names are labelled clearly. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

Prefer expect over unwrap for handling exceptions and make sure that tests are added when functionality is added or bugs fixed. Errors should be standardized and clear.

There should be documentation for functions that are more complex, located at the top of the function. Comments should explain things that are not immediately apparent in the code, such as why it was decided to write the code a certain way.
